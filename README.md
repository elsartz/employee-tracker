  # Installation
    It is a command-line application that's why we are going to need: 
   - Node.js to run the application and some modules from the npm library, 
     - Inquirer for the inputs, 
     - MySQL2 module to handle the database queries,
     - console.table for the print-out. 

  # Usage
    An application for viewing, managing and manipulating data for employees which can be easily converted for every company's size.
